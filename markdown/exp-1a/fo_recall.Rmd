Note: 

- Proportions are taken within condition and context (high/low). E.g., All the green bars in the top left sum to 1, all the orange bars in the top middle sum to 1, and so on. 
- Since non-numeric responses were permissible by the experiment's program, data was filtered to remove all non-numeric inputs. If a participant's inputs had a cumulative sum less than 20 or greater than 300, their results were removed.  In total, `r nrow(nr)` participants met this criteria.
