```

Note: 

- Proportions are taken within condition and context (high/low). E.g., All the green bars in the top left sum to 1, all the orange bars in the top middle sum to 1, and so on. 
- Since non-numeric responses were permissible by the experiment's program, data was filtered to remove all non-numeric inputs. If a participant's inputs had a cumulative sum less than 20 or greater than 300, their results were removed.  In total, `r nrow(nr)` participants met this criteria.

    2x3 Chi-Squared Tests
  </summary>

```{r}
source('r-scripts/exp-1b/fo-recall/chisq_fo_recall_analysis.R')

chi <- round(c(fo_high_test$statistic, fo_low_test$statistic), 2)
df <- round(c(fo_high_test$parameter, fo_low_test$parameter), 2)
p <- round(c(fo_high_test$p.value, fo_low_test$p.value), 3)
v <- round(c(fo_high_eff, fo_low_eff), 2)
```

<h4> High Value Results </h4>

```{r}
kable(fo_high_tab, 'html', caption = 'High Value Contingency Table') %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, position = "left", html_font = "Arial")
```

<br>

$\chi^2(`r df[1]`) = `r chi[1]`, p = `r p[1]`, \varphi_c = `r v[1]`$

- Recalling the extreme value is dependent on condition.


```{r}
kable(std_res_high, 'html', caption = 'Standardized Residuals', digits = 2) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, position = "float_left", html_font = "Arial")

kable(p_high, 'html', caption = 'p-values', digits = 3) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, position = "float_left", html_font = "Arial")
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

The *BEST 80-20* and *BEST 20-80* conditions both differ significantly from the expected value. The *BEST 80-20* condition tends to recall the extreme value, whereas *BEST 20-80* does not.

- BEST 80-20: $z = `r round(std_res_high[5], 2)`, p = `r round(p_high[5], 3)`$

- BEST 20-80: $z = `r round(std_res_high[6], 2)`, p = `r round(p_high[6], 3)`$

<br>


<h4> Low Value Results </h4>

```{r}
kable(fo_low_tab, 'html', caption = 'Low Value Contingency Table') %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, position = "left", html_font = "Arial")
```

<br>

$\chi^2(`r df[2]`) = `r chi[2]`, p = `r p[2]`, \varphi_c = `r v[2]`$

- Cannot rule out that recalling the extreme value is independent of group.


```{r}
kable(std_res_low, 'html', caption = 'Standardized Residuals', digits = 2) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, position = "float_left", html_font = "Arial")

kable(p_low, 'html', caption = 'p-values', digits = 3) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, position = "float_left", html_font = "Arial")
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

- None of the three conditions differ significantly from the expected value.

<br>

<h4>Post-Hoc Pairwise Fisher-Exact Tests</h4>

```{r}
kable(fish_tests, 'html', digits = 4) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, position = "left", html_font = "Arial")
```

<br>

- Recalling the extreme value was found to be dependent on condition ($p = `r round(fish_tests$p_value_adj[3], 3)`$) only when high value options in the BEST 80-20 and BEST 20-80 conditions are considered (Row 3 in the table). Everything else fails to reach significance.  

<br>

Note:

- In the contingency tables, 'Yes' indicates the extreme value was recalled, 'No' indicates that it was not.

- Only recalled outcomes that matched the programmed values were included. i.e., if they saw the *High Value Risky Door*, 80 was logged as "Yes" and 40 was logged as "No." If they saw the *Low Value Risky Door*, 0 was logged as "Yes", 40 was logged as "No". Participants who responded with any "other" values were removed from the analysis. Only Risky doors were evaluated. 

- In total, removing "other" responses resulted `r n_other` participants being excluded from these analyses leaving a final N = `r n_fo`.

- $\varphi_c$ is Cramér’s V, a measure of association for two nominal variables (i.e., an effect size of sorts). It can take a value between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating no association (i.e., full independence). 

- Post-hoc analysis on each $\chi^2$ test was conducted by evaluating the standardized residuals from the chi-square analysis because it seemed the most intuitive approach. However, pairwise Pearson Chi-squared or Fisher Exact tests across the three conditions were also run. The `p_value_adj` column shows corrected p-values using the Holm-Bonferroni method.
